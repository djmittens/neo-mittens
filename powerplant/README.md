## Gaming with Lutris
To setup the game scripts do the following.
- Inside of lutris set the post-launch and pre-launch scripts to  `gameoff.sh`  and `gameon-ultrawide.sh` respectively.
    - The menu is located under `Preferences -> Global Options`
    - This is optional as its annoying when using steam games.  Itll glitch out due to original process exiting and would toggle it off
- [x] Support for switching between main screen to be monitor or tv.
